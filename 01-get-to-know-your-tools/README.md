# PROJECT 1 - GET TO KNOW YOUR TOOLS

Discover: basic electrical theory, how a breadboard works, components in series and parralel
Time: 30 minutes
Level: 1

I learned about the electrical properties of voltage, current and resistance while building a circuit on a breadboard. With some components like LEDs, resistors and switches, I've created the simplest interactive system: a user presses the button, the light turns on.
